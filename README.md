# dem_v_rep

The goal of this project is to design a neural network that can fairly accurately predict whether tweets are coming from Democrat or Republican politicians.  The data I am using was not gathered by myself, but was downloaded from Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kapastor/democratvsrepublicantweets.  There are a total of 86,460 tweets, 42,068 from Democrats and 44,392 from Republicans.  Additionally, I will test whether adding a convolutional layer will increase the accuracy.  

Make sure you open dem_v_rep_classifier.py directly so that the working directory is set to wherever dem_v_rep is on your computer.
